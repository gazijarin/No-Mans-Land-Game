# Meeting with Elias November 18 6:30PM EST
You do need to have an up to date playable build for me to try. During the meeting, be prepared to answer the following:
## What feedback you have collected from your playtesting sessions. What feedback you have decided to move forward with and what feedback you decided to diregard and why.
- Player doesn't have time to develop relationship with aliens and map -> *Will address*
- Disconnect between jump and run -> *Addressed*
- Cannot tell when alien is chasing -> *Addressed; will add sound effects also*
- Need minimap showing where aliens are -> *Will address*
- Make oxygen tanks more visible -> *Addressed*
- Make oxygen go down faster so player must get oxygen -> *Addressed*
- Controls too sensitive -> *Disregarded*
